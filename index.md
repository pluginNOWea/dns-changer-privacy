What the app does

DNS Changer 2026 uses Android VpnService to route DNS queries only through the resolver you select (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare, Quad9, or a custom server). It is not a full VPN. Depending on device and settings, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) may be used.

Data we do NOT collect

We do not collect or store the websites you visit, DNS query contents, IP packets, or browsing history.

No account is required.

We do not collect precise location.

Data that may be processed

Device & app info (non-personal): app version, Android version, device model — for compatibility and troubleshooting.

User feedback: If you choose to send feedback by email, the message may include non-personal device information (model, Android version, screen size) which you can review before sending. This information is only used to help troubleshoot issues.

Advertising (AppLovin): Advertising ID and ad impression data are used to serve and measure ads. We do not control how ad partners handle data; see their policies in-app.

No in-app purchases, no analytics, no crash reporting.

DNS providers and third parties

Your DNS queries are sent directly to the resolver you choose. Their own privacy policies apply. For custom resolvers, you are responsible. Ads are provided by AppLovin; ad partner policies apply.

Retention

We do not retain DNS query logs. Any diagnostics (if generated) are limited and short-term.

Security

For DoH/DoT, DNS is encrypted in transit. We apply industry-standard safeguards for limited technical data.

Children

The app is not directed to children under 13.

Your choices

Change DNS resolver, or disconnect the local VPN anytime.

Opt out of ads personalization in device settings (Google → Ads).

Changes & Contact

We may update this Policy; the “Effective date” will be updated accordingly.
