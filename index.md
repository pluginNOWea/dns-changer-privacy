What the app does

DNS Changer 2026 uses Android VpnService to route DNS queries only through the resolver you select (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare, Quad9, or a custom server). It is not a full VPN. Depending on device and settings, DNS-over-TLS (DoT) or DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) may be used.

Data we do NOT collect

We do not collect or store the websites you visit, DNS query contents, IP packets, or browsing history.

No account is required.

We do not collect precise location.

Data that may be processed

Device & app info (non-personal): app version, Android version, device model — for compatibility and troubleshooting.

IP address & Advertising ID: may be processed by our advertising partners (Appodeal, AppLovin, AdMob) for serving and measuring ads.

User feedback: If you choose to send feedback by email, the message may include non-personal device information (model, Android version, screen size) which you can review before sending. This information is only used to help troubleshoot issues.

We do not use in-app purchases, analytics, or crash reporting.

Advertising and third parties

Ads are provided through Appodeal mediation, which may include networks such as AppLovin, AdMob, and others. These partners may process IP address, advertising ID, and ad impression data.

We do not control how ad partners handle data; please review their policies:

DNS providers

Your DNS queries are sent directly to the resolver you choose. Their own privacy policies apply. For custom resolvers, you are responsible.

Retention

We do not retain DNS query logs. Any diagnostics (if generated) are limited and short-term.

Security

For DoH/DoT, DNS is encrypted in transit. We apply industry-standard safeguards for limited technical data.

Children

The app is not directed to children under 13.

Your choices

Change DNS resolver, or disconnect the local VPN anytime.

Opt out of ads personalization in device settings (Google → Ads).

Changes & Contact

We may update this Policy; the “Effective date” will be updated accordingly.
